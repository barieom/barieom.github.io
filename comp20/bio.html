	<p class="light">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;My last name is pronounced "uhm," so people call me "Barium." Disclaimer: I am not a chemistry major.<br>
       &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I am a student at Tufts University with curiosity to learn and strong passion in making a difference in the world. Whether it be by directly helping someone in need or tackling grievous issues like homelessness in my community, I have always cherished the fact that anyone could be of positive influence, even if small, to the world.<br>
       &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Majoring in computer science and cognitive and brain sciences, I am invested in the varying impact major tech companies, as well as tech startups, have on society, as they function as the main facilitator of innovation and are currently one of the biggest drivers of change in the world. In particular, as a novice in this field, I am interested and hope to specialize in the machine learning/AI or the AR industry. For now, I am focused on developing my technical skills and learning as much as possible about CS and CBS. My coursework thus far includes - data structures, machine language and structure, OOP with GUI, linear algebra, discrete mathematics, and more.<br>
       &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Currently, I work as the Chair of Business Intelligence for the National Consulting Committee of the TAMID Group, analyzing consulting data on a national scale to improve the TAMID consulting vertical. In addition, for the TUFTS TAMID Group, I serve as the Director of Consulting and a consulting project manager, as well as leading weekly education seminars on varying consulting topics through Harvard Business Review Cases. In addition, I have conducted research on mind wandering through VTC analysis. As I have always been fascinated by the brain, I am ecstatic to have had the opportunity to do research on cognition as a side project. I am also a lead figure of Leonard Carmichael Society - a community service based umbrella organization with 1200+ members - and a part of Jumbo Code, a pro-bono tech development group on campus.<br>
       &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;My interests are soccer (#COYS), MLB and NFL statistics, being an unstable LA/SD Chargers fan, listening to and playing the piano, cooking, and reading books on philosophy. From the implications of Absurdism and the meaning of life to the recent emergence of Tottenham Hotspurs, I enjoy talking about a lot of things.
