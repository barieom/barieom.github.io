					<p class="about-text">I am launching the TAMID–Keyrus Data Science Group on the fall of 2018. I conceived the idea of this organization when I realized that most college campuses lack mediums for students to explore data science. Rather than taking online classes on my own, I decided to take initiative by creating a scalable national data science organization. I first persistently reached out to <a href="www.keyrus.com">Keyrus</a>, ultimately establishing a partnership with the international firm to incept the TAMID–Keyrus Data Science Group. I created the data science education curriculum with the help of Keyrus and resourced data case projects, Vistaprint being one of the clients. Now, the group is launched at Tufts University, with plans to expand nationally next year.</p>

In addition, I have conducted research on mind wandering through VTC analysis. As I have always been fascinated by the brain, I am ecstatic to have had the opportunity to do research on cognition as a side project. I am also a lead figure of Leonard Carmichael Society - a community service based umbrella organization with 1200+ members - and a part of Jumbo Code, a pro-bono tech development group on campus.</p>

My experience consists of working as an associate product owner at Vistaprint for the summer of 2018. I oversaw the whole product development an internal dashboard, working closely with my stakeholders–a dozen senior executives and directors. I delivered an MVP that was extremely well received and now the product is used by everyone at Vistaprint. Finally, of course, I have much to learn and am constantly learning to be a better PM. </p>

						<p>I've founded the TAMID-Keyrus Data Science Group. My interest in data stems from my love of sports, especially football, football (or soccer), and baseball.

						<p>I always thought my future was in academia, as both my parents work as professors; however, after much exposure to academia, I realized I wanted something more. Fully taking advantage of the saying 'try new things in college!,' I tried consulting without knowing what it really was, but fell in love with the dynamic and meaningful project based research work done in the consulting field. Since then, I've taken bigger roles in the TAMID Group and emerged as a leader.</p>

My initial motivation for going into computer science was to give myself the necessary tools to research the brain. Although my life has taken a different path, my interest in cognition is still here. My most recent research has been on mind wandering, and I hope to continue doing research on the brain as a side project.</p>
