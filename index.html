            <h2 class="h2-color"> Barium </h2>
            <p class="p-heading"> I'm Barry. But many people call me Barium, since my last name Eom is pronounced "Um". And my goal in life is to change the tech industry.</p>
            <p class="p-heading">
                Three things really define who I am: <em>sincerity</em>, <em>empathy</em>, and <em>optimism. </em></p>

            <h2 class="h2-color"> Humane and Sincere Technology </h2>
            <p class="p-heading">
                I love technology and software. But as much as I love tech, I'm worried about the direction that the tech industry is headed in. Many consumer tech products today are addictive, bad for our mental healths, and downright invasive. I want to change this; I want to make the tech industry be more humane, sincere, and genuinely good. </p> 
                <!--  along with leaders like Tristan Harris at <a href=https://humanetech.com/>Humane Tech</a>,  -->
            <p class="p-heading"> 
                One of the main issues with the tech industry is that many companies' ambitious, "make the world a better place" type of mission statements do not align with their business models. A company needs to be profitable, but this means their number one priority is growth and scaling. This often leads to obsession with measurable metrics like Monthly Active Users and engagement rates, and they often stray away from their ambitious, idealistic visions. It's not hard to find many companies that fell down this path—with the notable one being social media platforms like Facebook, where user engagement is $$$. 

            <p class="p-heading"> 
                This is where I strongly believe sincerity comes in. A good, humane technology products will be built by companies who genuinely strives to make the world a better place, where their business model aligns with its mission. I hope to grow to be a tech leader who embodies  the ethos and principles of <a href=https://humanetech.com/>Humane Technology</a>.
              </p>
           <!--  <p class="p-heading"> 
                With my experience launching a data science organization from zero to one, building pro-bono software solutions to nonprofits (such as a domestic violence prevention group), PM experience at Vistaprint, Microsoft, and Spotify, and strategy experience at EY-Parthenon's Software Strategy Group, I want to change the tech industry. </p>  -->

            <h2 class="h2-color"> My Life Missions </h2>
            <p class="p-heading"> My first goal is to create <em>sincere</em> and <em><i>good</i></em> technology products, products that bring us together, enhance our life experiences, and make all of us genuinely better. </p>
            <p class="p-heading"> My second goal is to pivot the tech industry as a whole to go in a different direction from where it's going now. By empowering/funding the right startups, change in incentive structures, and change in policies, I think this is possible.
            </p>
            <p class="p-heading"> My third (mostly and unrelated) mission is to contribute to and help accelerate the adoption of psychedelics to treat mental health, but this is just a side-passion for now!
            </p>
            
            <h2 class="h2-color"> My Experiences </h2>
            <p class="p-heading"> No need for a personal essay about my experiences—so check out my resume <a href="assets/files/resume.pdf">here</a>. Long story short, I'm a Product Manager at Datadog and a very popular open source product called <a href=https://vector.dev/>Vector.dev</a>, with PM experience at Spotify, Microsoft, and Vistaprint. I might go to business school — and more specifically MIT Sloan — in a few years, but who knows how much my perspectives and goals can change?

                <h1>Tufts Tech and Data Industry Night</h1>
                <p>In spring of 2019, there was a university wide event called Tufts Tech & Data Industry Night, with its purpose being an opportunity for the audience to reflect on the ethics of the technology industry's future. I directed this event.<br>
                With a team of five people, I was able to galvanize my team members to raise funds, even partnering with the Tufts Office of the Vice Provost. We used these funds to invite high profile speakers to our school, even flying in James Williams, a renowned author of Stand Out of Our Light and an advisor to the Center for Humane Technology, as our keynote speaker. Subsequently, we were able to resource high level executives from BitSight Technologies and Intralinks, additionally inviting the director of the Internet and Trust Consortium of MIT. Additionally, we were able to set up more than 20 companies to sponsor the event and send representatives for a networking event. <br>
                In the end, we had a massively successful event—starting with a keynote speaker, a speaker panel, and a networking event—achieving our goal of sparking vital conversations about the ethics of the tech industry and ensuring that the students at Tufts are aware and conscious about the importance of this issue beyond their college career and into their professional lives.</p>

                <p>For my Cognitive and Brain Sciences major, I wrote my final paper on how the effects of constant use of technology can be harmful to our brain and behavior in countless of ways. I also address the complexities and difficulties of conducting academia research on this topic. This paper received an A+ in the Cognitive and Brain Sciences Senior Seminar class.
