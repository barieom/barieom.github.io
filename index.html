                <p>I founded this organization on the spring of 2018. By formalizing a partnership with Keyrus, an international data intelligence firm, I created the blueprint of this organization (education, projects, operations, etc) with the help of our advisor, Razvan Nistor, who is a Director of Data Science at Keyrus. So far, we have 25 members, and are working on collaborative projects with our clients Wayfair and Vistaprint.

                <h1>Tufts Tech and Data Industry Night</h1>
                <p>In spring of 2019, there was a university wide event called Tufts Tech & Data Industry Night, with its purpose being an opportunity for the audience to reflect on the ethics of the technology industry's future. I directed this event.<br>
                With a team of five people, I was able to galvanize my team members to raise funds, even partnering with the Tufts Office of the Vice Provost. We used these funds to invite high profile speakers to our school, even flying in James Williams, a renowned author of Stand Out of Our Light and an advisor to the Center for Humane Technology, as our keynote speaker. Subsequently, we were able to resource high level executives from BitSight Technologies and Intralinks, additionally inviting the director of the Internet and Trust Consortium of MIT. Additionally, we were able to set up more than 20 companies to sponsor the event and send representatives for a networking event. <br>
                In the end, we had a massively successful eventâ€”starting with a keynote speaker, a speaker panel, and a networking eventâ€”achieving our goal of sparking vital conversations about the ethics of the tech industry and ensuring that the students at Tufts are aware and conscious about the importance of this issue beyond their college career and into their professional lives.</p>

                <h1>My Final Paper at Tufts on Tech's Effect on the Brain from an Academia Perspective</h1>
                <p>For my Cognitive and Brain Sciences major, I wrote my final paper on how the effects of constant use of technology can be harmful to our brain and behavior in countless of ways. I also address the complexities and difficulties of conducting academia research on this topic. This paper received an A+ in the Cognitive and Brain Sciences Senior Seminar class. Read it <a href="assets/prof-content/tuftsfinalpaper.pdf">here.</a></p>
