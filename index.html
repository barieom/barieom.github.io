    <p>Barium | Barry Eom | Byuri Eom | 엄벼리 | 嚴 ビョリ</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;My last name is pronounced "uhm," so people call me "Barium." Disclaimer: I am not a chemistry major.<br>
       &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I am a student at Tufts University with curiosity to learn and strong passion in making a difference in the world. Whether it be by directly helping someone in need or tackling grievous issues like homelessness in my community, I have always cherished the fact that anyone could be of positive influence, even if small, to the world.<br>
       &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Majoring in computer science and cognitive and brain sciences, I am invested in the varying impact major tech companies, as well as tech startups, have on society, as they function as the main facilitator of innovation and are currently one of the biggest drivers of change in the world. In particular, as a novice in this field, I am interested and hope to specialize in the machine learning/AI or the AR industry. For now, I am focused on developing my technical skills and learning as much as possible about CS and CBS. My coursework thus far includes - data structures, machine language and structure, OOP with GUI, linear algebra, discrete mathematics, and more.<br>
       &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Currently, I work as a consulting project manager representing the TAMID Group, as well as leading weekly education seminars on varying consulting topics through Harvard Business Review Cases. In addition, I am working on publishing a paper about my findings on Variance Time Course Analysis and mind wandering. As I have always been fascinated by the brain, I am ecstatic to have had the opportunity to do research on cognition as a side project. I am also a lead figure of Leonard Carmichael Society - a community service based umbrella organization with 1200+ members - and a part of Jumbo Code, a pro-bono tech development group on campus.<br>
       &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;My interests are soccer (#COYS), MLB and NFL statistics, being an unstable LA/SD Chargers fan, listening to and playing the piano, cooking, and reading books on philosophy. From the implications of Absurdism and the meaning of life to the recent emergence of Tottenham Hotspurs and fantasy football, I enjoy talking about a lot of things.

    </div>
    <div class="paragraph-shift"><p>Languages: C, C++, MATLAB, Python, Java, HTML/Javascript/CSS <br>
    	I started learning C++, my first 'comp sci' language, at the beginning of freshman year. Since then, I've picked up half a dozen languages and continue to find different problems to solve with my added skills. I'm always looking to improve and build upon my computer science skills. I've worked on several side projects - more detail can be found below. </p></div></div>

      <div class="dark-grey" style="height:28px;width:73%"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph-shift"><p>I always thought my future was in academia, as both my parents work as professors; however, after much exposure to academia, I realized I wanted something more. Fully taking advantage of the saying 'try new things in college!,' I tried consulting without knowing what it really was, but fell in love with the dynamic and meaningful project based research work done in the consulting field. Since then, I've taken bigger roles in the TAMID Group and emerged as a leader.</p></div></div>

    <div class="paragraph-shift"><p>I'm a leader. From founding and directing a fundraising event that has raised over $15,000 to being in charge of an on-campus group with more than 1200 members, I have the vision, passion, and integrity of a leader. As I believe that good leadership is founded upon the empowerment and motivation of a team/group, I try my best to connect to everyone and spark more ambition from them.</p></div></div>

    <div class="paragraph-shift"><p>Ever since reading masterpieces by Oliver Sacks, I have always been fascinated by the brain. My initial motivation for going into computer science was to give myself the necessary tools to research the brain. Although my life has taken a different path, my interest in cognition is still here. My most recent research has been on mind wandering, and I hope to continue doing research on the brain as a side project.</p></div></div>

    <div class="paragraph-shift"><p>I am fluent in Korean and Japanese (and... English!). In addition to being trilingual, I enjoy teaching, as I love breaking down something complex to something more simple, and am a good public speaker, as I lead weekly sessions on the cornerstones of consulting and Harvard Business Review Cases for Tufts University students interested in doing consulting. I also love data analysis and am a huge sports - soccer, baseball, football - statistics nerd.</p></div>

        <p>I founded this fundraiser my sophomore year of high school. The intention was to cultivate a culture of giving in Belmont, MA, a rather affluent town isolated from homelessness. Initially planned as a minor event, Coffeehouse for a Cause gained a lot of attention from many residents of the town and is now an yearly tradition, having raised more than $15,000 to combat homelessness in the Greater Boston Area. I am working on establishing another coffeehouse based fundraiser at Tufts University next fall.</p>
